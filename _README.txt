1) Create an InputAPKs/ folder in this directory. 

2) Add the apk files which you want to test in InputAPKs/ directory.

3) Launch an Android Emulator (or real device) and get the device name throgh the command "abd devices".
Be sure that the Emulator data have been wiped.

4) Execute AndroLeak. You can check its syntax with the command "python AndroLeak.py help".

5) At the execution end you can find results in the Results/ folder.

Important. During its execution, AndroLeak creates many temporary files. 
Don't worry about them since temporary files are managed automatically.
